The dungeon saving/loading in this code follows the specifications outlined in
the assignment. --save and --load trigger the program to save and load from a
default file $HOME/.rlg327/dungeon. Additionally, a --path flag has been added
that allows the user to specify a specific dungeon file.

When saving, rooms generated by this program are decomposed into 1x1 rooms.
Rooms are decomposed this way because circular rooms do not decompose into
rectangles cleanly.

There program implements some extra features on top of the specified save
format. After the basic loading routing is finished, the file is checked for
eof. If there is still more file to read, the program looks for a magic number
0x0BADF00D. If the magic number is found, additional information is read, such
as pillar locations and hardness of blocks in the rooms.
