For the purposes of this assignment dungeon simulation has been disabled. That
way the monster descriptions can be printed after parsing. Some new classes
were created for the purposes of this assignment, namely, the MonsterDecription
class and the Dice class.

During parsing if an error is encounted the parsing of that monster is skipped.
If the parser returns a vector of length zero it indicates that the entire
document was malformed. Parsing assumes that the monster file exists in 
$HOME/.rlg327/ and that the file is names monster_desc.txt
