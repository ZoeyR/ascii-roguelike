The dungeon generation in this code follows the specification outlined in the
project with a few added features. The dungeon itself is 160x105 with an
immutable barrier around the outside. 

Rooms are attempted to be placed in the dungeon until there are at least 10
rooms and 1000 attempts have been made to place rooms. Room minimum size is 
13x9, the specified minimum of 7x5 seemed too small. Rooms have the added
decoration of pillars being placed if the room is too large.

After rooms are generated a perfect maze (no loops) is created. The maze is
then joined together with the rooms (occasinally creating a loop) until there
is one connected unit. Dead ends are then trimmed. This ensures that the
dungeon is fully connected and corrodors will not extend into rooms.

The dungeon is displayed with "." for room blocks, "I" for pillars, ":" for
corrodors, and colored spaces for rock. If the rock is not adjacent to an open
area it is painted as a black space. Otherwise it is painted with a space
according to hardness. 0=Yellow, 1=White, 2=Light Gray, 3=Dark Gray, 
4/Immutable=Red.
