Monster descriptions and object descriptions are parsed from $HOME/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt
and $HOME/.rlg327/object_desc.txt respectively. These parsed descriptions are used to fill
the dungeon with monsters and objects based on them.

Objects and monsters have every dice value apart from damage pre-rolled before generation.

None of the new monster abilities have been implemented.

Currently there is no way to pick up or use objects since it was not part of the assignment
requirements.
