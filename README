The player has a 9x9 fog of war surrounding them, extending four blocks in
every direction. Monsters are only displayed when they are in the fog of war,
the player does not remember monster positions. A new keybinding has been
added, 'D'. when this key is pressed in look mode a debug view is toggled that
shows the entire map without a fog of war. The primary purpose of this is to
validate that the player view and dungeon match up.

The implementation differs slightly from the assignment specification. Since my
code is not based on the professors I only had one entity file. As such, I only
have one .cpp file in the assignment. Additionally, my code was structured such
that it didn't make sense for the player to hold onto its own view, since
entities were originally designed to be eventually use composition instead of
inheritance, and nesting the view with the player would complicate things
later.
