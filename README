The dungeon is printed in an 80x24 area. The top row and bottom 2 rows are
dedicated to status areas. The game area is outlined by a border, giving the
play area a size of 78x19. No additional mappings other than the ones specified
in the requirements document have been implemented.

Additionally, a new flag has been added to the program "-f", which will cause
game to take up the entire terminal size if your terminal is larger than 80x24.
