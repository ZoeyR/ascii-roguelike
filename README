The distance calculation in this code follows the specifications outlined in
the assignment. Two distance calculations are done when the program is run. The
first is for non-tunneling monsters. These monsters can only move through open
spaces and each open space has a weight of 1. Tunneling monsters can move
through rock. Calculating the weight for this puts the hardness of the rock
into multiple bins [1, 84][85, 170][171, 220][221, 254] and 255. These bins
have weights of 1, 2, 3, 4, and Infinite respectively.

Distances are printed in a colorized form to make it easier to see patterns in
the output. There are 10 different colors and each one is associated with a 
distance mod 10.
